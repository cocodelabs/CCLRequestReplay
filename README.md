[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cocodelabs/CCLRequestReplay.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cocodelabs/CCLRequestReplay)

CCLRequestReplay is greatly inspired by VCRURLConnection, however it supports
creating a recording purely from code instead of having to actually record the
requests manually and store them in a json file.

*Very alpha, work in progress. New features coming by the hour/day.*
